Ansible now has a helm module:
   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/helm_module.html
I have not used it because of this showstopper: 
   https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/32545
and because use of a role would require refactoring shortly 
thereafter. 

This follows a general trend of avoiding Ansible for tasks 
that are unlikely to benefit from the increased complexity 
or overhead that Ansible would introduce.
